        We examine the association between studying science in higher secondary school and labor market earnings in India. Studying science in high school is associated with 22% greater earnings than studying business or humanities. Earnings for science students are further enhanced with some fluency in English. Science education is also associated with more years of education, completing a professional degree, returns to entrepreneurship and working in public sector positions. Primary survey of high school students shows no discernible differences in behavioral characteristics of science students compared to others.

        Do foreign students affect the economic outcomes of the natives in places with post-secondary institutions? I address this question by examining the impacts of demand shocks induced by expansions in foreign post-secondary student enrollment in the US between 2004 and 2016. Using an instrumental variables strategy that exploits spatial variation in foreign student enrollment expansion over this period, I estimate the causal effects on a vector of local economic outcomes. On average, the demand shocks substantially increased local employment and wages while having no significant effect on housing rent. At the same time, I find no evidence of adverse spillover effects on neighboring areas without post-secondary institutions. Further, the effects on employment and wages increase with population density. However, the effect on housing rent also increases, likely due to limited supply in densely populated areas. The results suggest welfare gains for natives, especially in less densely populated areas depending heavily on the education sector. While the effect of changes in foreign student enrollment on the local economy is sizable, the effect of changes in domestic student enrollment is small during the same period.

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. Using an alimony law change in the US that significantly reduced the post-divorce alimony support among women, I first show that this led to an increase in divorce probability. Second, consistent with the theoretical prediction from a simple model of labor supply, the reform led to an increase in the female labor force participation, with a larger increase among ever-married and more educated samples of women. As a result, the average female wage income increased after the reform. While labor supply increased, I show that most of this increase was concentrated in part-time employment, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the expected loss in alimony income. I estimate a net loss of $40,621 in PDV of lifetime income due to the reform. In light of the recent movement in the US to reform alimony laws, these findings are pertinent to understand its implications on women's labor supply and economic well-being.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper analyses the role of technology in reducing heat-induced labor productivity losses. For this, we use a field experiment in India which randomized the use of <em>productivity-augmenting</em> digital mode versus classic paper-and-pen mode for conducting 2000 household surveys. Combining this experimentally induced variation in survey mode with day-to-day variation in temperature, we estimate the impact of survey mode on surveyor productivity as temperature rises. We find that as temperature rises and working conditions start to deteriorate, using digital-mode results in 5 percent higher surveyor-productivity compared to paper surveys. These relative productivity gains are mainly concentrated on extremely hot days - where the adverse impact of heat is likely at its peak. We show that these impacts are not driven by differences in characteristcis of surveyor or respondents, thereby pointing to the role of technology in reducing the adverse effects of heat.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;"> In this paper, we analyze the impact of disciplinary removal of students to alternative schools on short-run and long-run outcomes of removed and regular students. We use the administrative records of all students in Texas public schools between 1999 and 2014, including their referrals to the Disciplinary Alternative Education Programs (DAEPs) and Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Programs (JJAEPs) which provided educational programming during periods of disciplinary removal. We employ two different empirical strategies to analyze the impact. First, noting that physical distance to DAEP campuses is an important determinant of a school’s propensity to refer students to DAEPs, we use the variation in the timing of the entry and exit of local DAEPs across Texas, employing an event-study design to analyze the impact. For the second empirical strategy, we exploit the fact that only counties of a certain size were required to establish JJAEPs, and use district population cutoff to estimate the impact of JJAEPs in an RD framework. </font></p></details></ul>

<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;"> Academic assortative matching between college quality and student ability has been argued to maximizes the efficiency of human capital production. Existing literature indicate that there exists a mismatch between student and college quality that is unexplained by differences in factors such as, students’ test scores, SAT scores, demographic characteristics, parental income, financial aid, etc. This paper analyzes the impact of a student's high school class rank on their college application choices. Linking individual-level administrative records of high schools students in Texas to their college applications data between 2000 to 2016, I use a fixed-effects framework similar to Murphy and Weinhardt (2020) to analyze the impact of rank on college application. Preliminary findings show that for two students with same standardized test score (a proxy for ability), having higher class rank increases the propensity of applying to better ranked colleges. This suggests that variation in class ranks among similar students can account for some of the mismatches in college and student quality. </font></p></details></ul>

For this, we use the data on street light outages from complaints reported to Chicago’s 311 reporting system and map it to the publicly available microdata on crimes from the Chicago Police Department. First, we show that after controlling for census block and time fixed effects, distribution of streetlight outages are as good as random. Then, using the residual idiosyncratic variation in streetlight outages, we estimate the impact on crimes in the treatment neighborhood relative to the control neighborhood with no outages. Finally, we link the streetlight outages to data on civilian-police interactions to understand the effect of ambient lighting on police behavior and use of force. </font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;"> This project studies test-score and income gaps between Black and white Americans. We investigate these gaps using longitudinal administrative education and earnings records from the Texas Education Resource Center, focusing on a panel of children from recent cohorts (1986-91) who are observed continuously from 3rd grade through age 30. Our headline finding is that Black students performing at the 80th percentile of test scores have earnings in early adulthood similar to white students performing at the 20th percentile of test scores. We also find stark differences in the persistence of relative performance. Black students with low test scores are very likely to have low earnings, while white students with low test scores demonstrate much more upward mobility. Conversely, Black students with high test scores demonstrate much more downward mobility than white students with high test scores. Ongoing work decomposes the gaps into differences in high school graduation, college enrollment, major choice, industry, and location. Our findings, although descriptive, appear inconsistent with a popular narrative that closing test-score gaps between Black and white Americans would substantially reduce the gaps that appear at later ages in labor market outcomes.</font></p></details></ul>-->
