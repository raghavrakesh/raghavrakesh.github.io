  <details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the long-run effects of disruptive peers in disciplinary schools on educational and labor market outcomes of students placed at these institutions. The existing literature suggests that students placed at disciplinary schools tend to have significantly worse future outcomes. We provide evidence that the composition of peers at these institutions plays an important role in explaining this link. We use rich administrative data of high school students in Texas which provides a detailed record of each student's disciplinary placements, including their exact date of placement and assignment duration. This allows us to identify the relevant peers for each student based on their overlap at the institution. We leverage within school-year variation in peer composition at each institution to ask whether a student who overlaps with particularly disruptive peers has worse subsequent outcomes. We show that exposure to peers in highest quintile of disruptiveness relative to lowest quintile when placed at a disciplinary school increases students' subsequent removals (5-8% per year); reduces their educational attainment -- lower high-school graduation (6%), college enrollment (7%), and college graduation (17%); and worsens labor market outcomes -- lower employment (2.5%) and earnings (6.5%). Moreover, these effects are stronger when students have a similar peer group in terms of the reason for removal, or when the distribution of disruptiveness among peers is more concentrated than dispersed around the mean. Our findings draw attention to an unintended consequence of student removal to disciplinary schools, and highlights how brief exposures to disruptive peers can affect an individual's long-run trajectories.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">Women bear a disproportionate share of health and time burden associated with lack of access to modern energy. In this paper, we study the impact of clean energy access on adult health and labor supply outcomes by exploiting a nationwide rollout of clean cooking fuel program in Indonesia. This program led to a large-scale fuel switching, from kerosene, a dirty fuel, to liquid petroleum gas, a cleaner one. Using longitudinal survey data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey and exploiting the staggered structure of the program rollout, we find that access to clean cooking fuel led to a significant improvement in women's health, particularly among those who spend most of their time indoors doing housework. We also find an increase in women's work hours, suggesting that access to cleaner fuel can improve women's health and plausibly their productivity, allowing them to supply more market labor. For men, we find an increase in the work hours and propensity to have an additional job, mainly in households where women accrued the largest health and labor benefits from the program. These results highlight the role of clean energy in reducing gender disparity in health and point to the existence of positive externalities from the improved health of women on other members of the household.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. Using an alimony law change in the US that significantly reduced the post-divorce alimony support among women, I first show that this led to an increase in divorce probability. Second, consistent with the theoretical prediction from a simple model of labor supply, the reform led to an increase in the female labor force participation, with a larger increase among ever-married and more educated samples of women. As a result, the average female wage income increased after the reform. While labor supply increased, I show that most of this increase was concentrated in part-time employment, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the expected loss in alimony income. I estimate a net loss of $40,621 in PDV of lifetime income due to the reform. In light of the recent movement in the US to reform alimony laws, these findings are pertinent to understand its implications on women's labor supply and economic well-being.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper analyses the role of technology in reducing heat-induced labor productivity losses. For this, we use a field experiment in India which randomized the use of <em>productivity-augmenting</em> digital mode versus classic paper-and-pen mode for conducting 2000 household surveys. Combining this experimentally induced variation in survey mode with day-to-day variation in temperature, we estimate the impact of survey mode on surveyor productivity as temperature rises. We find that as temperature rises and working conditions start to deteriorate, using digital-mode results in 5 percent higher surveyor-productivity compared to paper surveys. These relative productivity gains are mainly concentrated on extremely hot days - where the adverse impact of heat is likely at its peak. We show that these impacts are not driven by differences in characteristcis of surveyor or respondents, thereby pointing to the role of technology in reducing the adverse effects of heat.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. I exploit the Massachusettsâ€™ Alimony Reform Act of 2011 which significantly reduced post-divorce alimony support, primarily among women. Consistent with theoretical predictions from a simple model oflabor supply in the presence of divorce and alimony payments, I show that the reform led to â€”a) an increase in separation probabilities, b) an increase in female labor force participation, and c)an increase in average female wage-income after the reform.  While women increased their labor participation in response to the reform, most of this increase occurred in low-paid part-time jobs, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the lost alimony income.  A back of the envelope calculation suggests a net reduction in the expected lifetime income of women due to the reform. These findings are pertinent in understanding the implications of the recent movement in the US for elimination of the lifetime alimony provision.</font></p></details></ul>-->

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;"> In this paper, we analyze the impact of disciplinary removal of students to alternative schools on short-run and long-run outcomes of removed and regular students. We use the administrative records of all students in Texas public schools between 1999 and 2014, including their referrals to the Disciplinary Alternative Education Programs (DAEPs) and Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Programs (JJAEPs) which provided educational programming during periods of disciplinary removal. We employ two different empirical strategies to analyze the impact. First, noting that physical distance to DAEP campuses is an important determinant of a schoolâ€™s propensity to refer students to DAEPs, we use the variation in the timing of the entry and exit of local DAEPs across Texas, employing an event-study design to analyze the impact. For the second empirical strategy, we exploit the fact that only counties of a certain size were required to establish JJAEPs, and use district population cutoff to estimate the impact of JJAEPs in an RD framework. </font></p></details></ul>

<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;"> Academic assortative matching between college quality and student ability has been argued to maximizes the efficiency of human capital production. Existing literature indicate that there exists a mismatch between student and college quality that is unexplained by differences in factors such as, studentsâ€™ test scores, SAT scores, demographic characteristics, parental income, financial aid, etc. This paper analyzes the impact of a student's high school class rank on their college application choices. Linking individual-level administrative records of high schools students in Texas to their college applications data between 2000 to 2016, I use a fixed-effects framework similar to Murphy and Weinhardt (2020) to analyze the impact of rank on college application. Preliminary findings show that for two students with same standardized test score (a proxy for ability), having higher class rank increases the propensity of applying to better ranked colleges. This suggests that variation in class ranks among similar students can account for some of the mismatches in college and student quality. </font></p></details></ul>

For this, we use the data on street light outages from complaints reported to Chicagoâ€™s 311 reporting system and map it to the publicly available microdata on crimes from the Chicago Police Department. First, we show that after controlling for census block and time fixed effects, distribution of streetlight outages are as good as random. Then, using the residual idiosyncratic variation in streetlight outages, we estimate the impact on crimes in the treatment neighborhood relative to the control neighborhood with no outages. Finally, we link the streetlight outages to data on civilian-police interactions to understand the effect of ambient lighting on police behavior and use of force. </font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;"> This project studies test-score and income gaps between Black and white Americans. We investigate these gaps using longitudinal administrative education and earnings records from the Texas Education Resource Center, focusing on a panel of children from recent cohorts (1986-91) who are observed continuously from 3rd grade through age 30. Our headline finding is that Black students performing at the 80th percentile of test scores have earnings in early adulthood similar to white students performing at the 20th percentile of test scores. We also find stark differences in the persistence of relative performance. Black students with low test scores are very likely to have low earnings, while white students with low test scores demonstrate much more upward mobility. Conversely, Black students with high test scores demonstrate much more downward mobility than white students with high test scores. Ongoing work decomposes the gaps into differences in high school graduation, college enrollment, major choice, industry, and location. Our findings, although descriptive, appear inconsistent with a popular narrative that closing test-score gaps between Black and white Americans would substantially reduce the gaps that appear at later ages in labor market outcomes.</font></p></details></ul>
