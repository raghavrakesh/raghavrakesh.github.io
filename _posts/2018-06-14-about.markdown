<p><font color="#000000">I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at Michigan State University. My research interest is in Labor Economics and Economics of Education. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned a BA (Hons.) in Economics from Hans Raj College, University of Delhi, and an MA in Economics from Delhi School of Economics (DSE), University of Delhi. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">I am interested in topics related to determinants of human capital development, as well as examining the academic and labor market returns to skilling, entrepreneurship training, and alternative pedagogies. </font></p>
 
<p><font color="#000000">My Job Market Paper studies the effects of foreign peers on domestic students' academic outcomes in post-secondary education in the US. My other Ph.D. work studies the economic spillover effects of foreign students in places with host post-secondary institutions.  </font></p>
